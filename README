This is just a set of hack scripts that I've added to Redmine for our agile management @ Razoo.  

I'm positive this will be of no use to anyone... other than:

* Throwing mud, saying... "use Rails, you fool"
* Maybe, possibly, learning some SQL tricks (that break all Rails conventions)

To Install:

* export this git repo, and copy the things under script/ to the script/ directory in Redmine

Please don't get me wrong.  I like Rails a lot... Our engineering team @ Razoo is amazing... So, this is the dangerous stuff that happens when the CTO starts tinkering with data.  

Anyway.. enjoy :)
